# Embedded
All of the development is done using an STM32-F446RE board using STM32CubeIDE. HAL is not used in any of the projects in favor of learning the registers and how they function. 

These folders only include a .c file and were used for testing purposes. New projects will have their own repo and will contain all files as necessary.

*Most of the code is overcommented but this is the case to allow me to look back later and understand why I did something or what a component does*
