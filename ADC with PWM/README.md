# What it does
Utilizes Pulse Width Modulation to smoothly increase/decrease LED brightness based on the direction of the potentiometer. Converts the analog voltage to a digital value which is then multipled by the ARR of the timer and divided by the resolution (4096) to get a brightness value.

- Pulse Width Modulation
- Analog to Digital Conversion
- Timer Configs
- GPIO Configs with Alternate Functions
