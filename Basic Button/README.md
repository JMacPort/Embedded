# What it does
Two buttons to toggle how an LEDs output works. One button (PA 9) turns the LED on and initilizes its state to 0. Meaning the LED is on and there is no pattern. If the other button (PA10) is pressed while the state of the button is on, it will cause the LED to blink every so many seconds.
